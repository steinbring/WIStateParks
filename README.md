# The unofficial Wisconsin State Parks Application

## Description

I started working on writing this app in 2021 after setting a [goal to visit every state park in Wisconsin](https://travels.jws.app/post/646625422495383552/2021-travel-goals).  The goal is for this app to answer the question of "What state parks can I realisticly visit today, that I haven't been to, yet?".
